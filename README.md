SDRFMReceiver
=============

Flowgraphs from John Malsbury's "How To Build an FM Receiver with the USRP in Less Than 10 Minutes" video for GNU Radio 3.7

[John Malsbury's tutorial video](http://www.ettus.com/kb/detail/sdr-for-beginners-building-an-fm-receiver-with-the-usrp-and-gnu-radio)

Created fm_example.grc by studying John's video. [The version available from the ettus site](http://files.ettus.com/app_notes/fm_rcvr/fm_example.grc) does not open correctly in GNU Radio 3.7
